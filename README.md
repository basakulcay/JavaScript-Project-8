Mini Linter (Iterators)


1.In the code editor, there is a string called story. We want to gather some information about the individual words and sentences in the string. Letâ€™s split the string into individual words and save them in a new array called storyWords.


2. Log how many words there are in this story to the console.

3. There is an array of words that are unnecessary. Iterate over your array to filter out these words. Save the remaining words in an array called betterWords. There are several ways that you could achieve this.


4. There is an array of words called overusedWords. These are words overused in this story. You want to let the user of your program know how many times they have used these overused words. There are two ways to achieve this. Try it on your own first. If you need help, consult the hint.

5. Now, count how many sentences are in the paragraph.

This may seem tricky, but remember that all of the sentences in this paragraph end with a period (.) or an exclamation mark (!). You could iterate over the array and add 1 to a sentence counter variable for each word that has a period or exclamation mark as its final character.


6. Log these items to the console:

    The word count
    The sentence count
    The number of times each overused word appears

You could choose to simply log them one by one or, for a challenge, create a function that logs all of them with some formatting.

7. Now, log the betterWords array to the console as a single string.
